General Design & UI Guidelines for AI Assistance (React/Tailwind/shadcn)
These rules guide AI implementation of UI elements to ensure visual consistency,
adherence to design specifications, and best practices for modern web development
using React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.
Core Principles:
Primacy of Visual Specifications:
Base all UI implementation primarily on the provided target design images, mockups,
or detailed visual specification documents (e.g., CopyCoder outputs, Figma links).
Pay close attention to layout, spacing, typography, color palettes, rounding, and
overall visual hierarchy depicted in the specs.
Leverage Component Library:
Use shadcn/ui First: Whenever implementing standard UI elements (Buttons, Cards,
Forms, Inputs, Dialogs, Menus, Tables, Alerts, etc.), always use the corresponding
components from the shadcn/ui library (assuming it's installed in the project). Import
them from @/components/ui/....
Custom Components: Only create custom UI components from scratch if a suitable
shadcn/ui component does not exist or cannot be easily adapted for the required
functionality or unique visual style.
Styling with Tailwind CSS:
Implement all styling using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
Apply colors, spacing, typography, layout (Flexbox/Grid), rounding, shadows, etc.,
using Tailwind classes based on the visual specifications.
No Custom CSS/Styled-Components: Avoid writing custom CSS files (.css, .scss) or
using CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components unless absolutely necessary for
complex animations, highly specific overrides, or if it's an established pattern in the
project, and only with explicit instruction.
Iconography:
Default Icon Library (Lucide React):
For icons within the application (buttons, status indicators, list items, etc.), use icons
from the lucide-react library by default, as it integrates well with shadcn/ui and
Tailwind.
Import icons directly: import { IconName } from 'lucide-react';
Icon Specification & Usage:
When specific icons are required for UI elements based on design specs, use the
specified lucide-react icon name.
If no specific icon is given, choose a lucide-react icon that semantically matches the
element's purpose (e.g., Trash2 for delete, Edit for edit, Plus for add, Check for
success, X for close/fail, AlertTriangle for warning, Download for download).
Apply size (e.g., h-4 w-4, h-5 w-5) and color (e.g., text-red-500, text-green-600)
using Tailwind classes as needed to match the design.
Verification: Always double-check chosen icon names against the official Lucide
library documentation (https://lucide.dev/) if unsure.
Layout & Responsiveness:
Responsive Design:
Implement layouts that are responsive and adapt gracefully to different screen sizes
(mobile, tablet, desktop).
Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) extensively to adjust layout,
spacing, typography, and visibility across breakpoints.
Utilize Flexbox (flex, items-center, justify-between, etc.) and CSS Grid (grid, grid-
cols-*, gap-*, etc.) via Tailwind classes for layout structure.
Consistency:
Maintain consistency in spacing (padding/margins using p-*, m-*, space-x-*),
typography (font sizes/weights using text-*, font-*), border rounding (rounded-*), and
color usage across the application, adhering to the project's design system or visual
specs.
