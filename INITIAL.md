- Supporting formats: Blog articles, YouTube/TikTok Shorts

**Publishing Automation:**
- Notion integration with BuildFast template structure
- Image generation via Glif.com workflow or Replicate API
- 24-hour BuildFast auto-sync to live blogs
- Slack notifications when content goes live
- GHL MCP for automated social media posting across all platforms

**Client Configuration:**
- Checkbox controls for each content format
- Custom posting schedules per platform
- Brand voice and image style preferences
- Performance tracking and optimization settings

### System 3: ADSBY AMPLIFICATION Requirements

**Google Ad Grant Management:**
- 4 active clusters at $2,500 budget each
- Weekly performance review and rotation
- Drop worst performer, promote new cluster
- Adsby API integration for campaign management
- AdsBot dashboard for performance monitoring

**Performance Optimization:**
- Automated budget allocation based on performance metrics
- CTR, conversion rate, and authority impact scoring
- Slack notifications for significant performance changes
- Monthly authority impact reports for clients

### Integration Requirements:

**API Integrations:**
- Grok API (X trending posts, media settings only)
- Reddit MCP for viral content analysis
- Google Trends API for long-term data
- Glif.com or Replicate API for image generation
- GHL MCP for social media automation
- Adsby API for Google Ads management
- BuildFast Notion template sync (manual, no API)

**Database Architecture:**
- Extend existing Supabase CIA schema
- Add Cartwheel cluster tracking and content management
- Publishing status across all platforms
- Ad campaign performance and budget tracking
- Client configuration and preferences

**Performance Requirements:**
- Convergence analysis: Complete within 1 hour weekly

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

### Modular Architecture:
- Each system (CIA, Cartwheel, Adsby) operates independently
- Clean integration points with data handoffs
- Optional modules can be enabled/disabled per client
- Scalable design for future system additions

### Client Flexibility:
- Complete checkbox control over content formats
- Custom scheduling and brand voice options
- Performance-based optimization recommendations
- White-label potential for agency resale

### Automation Safeguards:

- Scalable for multiple simultaneous clients
- Performance reporting aligned with business KPIs
- Revenue attribution and ROI tracking capabilities

### Technical Scalability:
- Context Engineering framework for rapid feature addition
- Database schema designed for growth
- API rate limiting and error handling
- Session management across all three systems

### Known Technical Challenges:
- Grok API rate limits for trending post analysis
- BuildFast 24-hour sync limitation (no real-time publishing)
- GHL MCP reliability for cross-platform posting
- Convergence algorithm accuracy for viral trend prediction
- Google Ad Grant compliance and spending optimization

### Success Criteria:
1. **CIA System**: Complete 6-phase analysis with Master Archives
2. **Convergence Detection**: Weekly viral opportunities identified automatically
3. **Content Multiplication**: 12+ formats generated from single cluster
4. **Publishing Pipeline**: Notion → BuildFast → Live blogs functioning
5. **Social Distribution**: GHL posting across all enabled platforms
6. **Ad Amplification**: $10k budget rotation with performance optimization
7. **Client Control**: Full checkbox configuration system functional
8. **Performance Tracking**: Real-time metrics and weekly optimization reports

### Development Priorities:
1. **Phase 1**: Complete CIA system implementation
2. **Phase 2**: Build Cartwheel convergence and content generation
