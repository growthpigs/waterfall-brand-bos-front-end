# CLAUDE.md - Brand BOS Project Rules and Context

## Project Overview - Brand BOS
**Brand BOS** is a professional services authority platform implementing the Authority Avalanche methodology for financial advisors and professional service firms. The platform transforms client testimonials into narrative-driven content across multiple channels to establish thought leadership and generate qualified leads.

## Technology Stack - Brand BOS
- **Frontend**: React + Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Content Management**: Automated testimonial transformation workflows
- **Distribution**: Multi-channel content automation (LinkedIn, email, blog)
- **Analytics**: Content performance and engagement tracking
- **Authentication**: Professional client portal access
- **Deployment**: Vercel with CDN optimization

## CRITICAL: SuperClaude Integration for Brand BOS

### Always Use SuperClaude Commands for Development
- **NEVER use traditional prompts** - Always use SuperClaude commands
- **ALWAYS apply appropriate personas** for specialized expertise
- **INCLUDE Brand BOS context flags** in every command
- **USE MCP servers** for enhanced development capabilities

### SuperClaude Command Priority for Brand BOS
1. **`/load`** - Always start with project context loading
2. **`/analyze`** - Analyze issues before fixing
3. **`/improve`** - Fix identified problems
4. **`/build`** - Rebuild components when needed

## Brand BOS Specific Development Rules

### Layout Issues (CURRENT PRIORITY)
**ALWAYS use these commands for layout problems:**
```bash
/analyze --layout --sidebar --spacing --persona-frontend --professional-services --evidence
/improve --layout --sidebar-spacing --persona-frontend --professional-services --magic
/build --component "ComponentName" --layout-fix --persona-frontend --professional-services
```

### Professional Services UI Standards
- **Clean, trustworthy design** that builds authority and credibility
- **Consistent spacing** between sidebar and content (24px standard)
- **Background differentiation** between sidebar and main content areas
- **Theme-independent layout** - structure stays same regardless of color
- **Mobile-responsive** design for professional audiences

### Authority Avalanche Methodology Integration
- **Testimonial transformation** workflows using Frank Kern narrative approach
- **Multi-channel content distribution** automation
- **Authority measurement** and analytics integration
- **Professional services workflow** optimization

## Mandatory SuperClaude Usage Patterns

### For Layout Issues (Your Current Problem)
```bash
# ALWAYS start with context loading
/load --full --analyze --persona-frontend --professional-services --c7

# Analyze the specific issue
/analyze --layout --sidebar --spacing --persona-frontend --professional-services --evidence

# Fix the identified problems
/improve --layout --sidebar-spacing --theme-consistency --persona-frontend --professional-services --magic
```

### For Component Problems
```bash
# Component analysis
/analyze --components --consistency --persona-frontend --authority-content --c7

# Component improvement
/improve --components --cross-page-consistency --persona-frontend --professional-services --magic

# Component rebuilding if needed
/build --component "ComponentName" --professional-services --persona-frontend --magic
```

### For Authority Content Features
```bash
# Authority content development
/build --component "TestimonialCard" --authority-content --persona-mentor --magic

# Content workflow automation  
/build --workflow "authority-avalanche" --content-automation --persona-architect --seq
```

## Required Personas for Brand BOS

### Primary Personas (Use Most Often)
- **`--persona-frontend`** - React/Next.js UI expertise (CRITICAL for layout issues)
