## Usage Examples

```bash
# Check all apps
npm run health:all

# Check only modified apps (faster)
npm run health:modified

# Run full health check with coverage
npm run health:all health:full

# Run CI version
npm run health:all health:ci
```

## Configuration

### Vitest Configuration
Each app has a `vitest.config.ts` with:
- React support
- JSDOM environment
- Path aliases
- Coverage thresholds

### Pre-commit Hooks
Automatically runs health checks on modified apps before commit.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Dependencies not installed**: Run `npm run setup:health-system`
2. **Pre-commit hooks not working**: Check `.husky/pre-commit` permissions
3. **Tests failing**: Check `src/test/setup.ts` for proper mocking

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check specific app
cd dashboard && npm run health:check

# Run with verbose output
npm run health:all health:ci

# Check coverage
cd dashboard && npm run test:coverage
```
