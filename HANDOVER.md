## Critical Technical Decisions Made

### Database Architecture
- **Supabase PostgreSQL** for primary data storage with Row Level Security
- **Multi-tenant isolation** via RLS policies for unlimited client scaling
- **Master Archives** system for intelligence preservation between CIA phases
- **Performance optimization** through proper indexing and connection pooling

### Context Window Management  
- **70% usage threshold** for automatic handover creation
- **Master Archive synthesis** prevents intelligence loss between phases
- **Session state recovery** across context limits with zero data loss
- **Compressed prompts** achieve 70-85% reduction while maintaining analytical depth

### Human-in-Loop Workflows
- **Phase 2A (DataForSEO):** Mandatory pause for keyword research data
- **Phase 3A (Perplexity):** Mandatory pause for trend research  
- **Content Approval:** Human review before publishing (configurable)
- **Dual notifications:** Slack + Email for redundancy and reliability

### API Integration Strategy
- **DataForSEO:** Keywords and SERP analysis (credentials: eca1d1f1229a0603)
- **Grok API:** X trending posts (media-only filtering)
- **Reddit MCP:** Viral content from marketing subreddits
- **Google Trends:** Long-term pattern validation
- **GHL MCP:** Multi-platform social media posting
- **BuildFast/Notion:** Blog publishing (24-hour sync limitation)
- **Glif.com:** Brand-consistent image generation

## Framework Preservation Requirements - CRITICAL
**These customer psychology frameworks MUST be maintained throughout:**
- **Benson Points 1-77+:** Complete customer psychology framework
- **Frank Kern Methodology:** Narrative-driven customer journey analysis  
- **Daniel Priestley 5 P's:** Authority building framework (Pitch, Publish, Product, Profile, Partnership)
- **Golden Hippo Methodology:** Offer development and positioning frameworks

## Implementation Priority Sequence
**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** CIA System Foundation
- Database schema and models setup
- Core 6-phase execution engine  
- Context window monitoring and handovers
- Human-in-loop workflows (DataForSEO, Perplexity)
- Master Archive synthesis system

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Cartwheel Content Engine
- Convergence detection engine (Grok, Reddit, Google Trends)
- Content multiplication pipeline (12+ formats)
- Publishing coordination (Notion/BuildFast, GHL MCP)
- Human approval workflow system
- Client configuration integration

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Adsby Amplification
- Google Ad Grant management ($10k rotation)
- Campaign creation from content clusters
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Budget rotation based on performance metrics

**Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16):** Integration & Polish
- Cross-system integration testing
- Performance optimization
- User interface development (React/Tailwind/shadcn)
- Quality assurance and validation

## Success Criteria Established
- [ ] **CIA System:** All 6 phases execute with 70-85% context reduction
- [ ] **Context Management:** Handovers trigger at 70% usage automatically
- [ ] **Human-in-Loop:** Slack + Email notifications deliver reliably
- [ ] **Intelligence Preservation:** All frameworks maintained across phases
- [ ] **Content Generation:** 12+ formats from single convergence in <2 hours
- [ ] **Publishing Pipeline:** Notion delivery in 24hrs, social posting in 30min
- [ ] **Client Controls:** Checkbox format enable/disable functional
- [ ] **Performance:** <3 minute phases, <70% context usage per phase

## Known Technical Challenges
1. **Grok API rate limiting** for trending post analysis
2. **BuildFast 24-hour sync limitation** (not real-time publishing)  
3. **Context window management** across complex 6-phase analysis
4. **Multi-tenant data isolation** for unlimited client scaling
5. **Quality control** for AI-generated content maintaining brand consistency
6. **Human-in-loop timing** for DataForSEO and Perplexity workflows

## Development Environment Setup
**Required Services:**
- **Supabase account** (user's own, NOT War Room shared)
- **DataForSEO API access** (credentials provided)
- **Slack workspace** for notifications
- **Email SMTP** for backup notifications
- **GitHub repository** for version control

**Tech Stack:**
- **Backend:** Python/FastAPI or Node.js/Express  
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Vector DB:** Pinecone (if needed for RAG performance)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend) + Railway/Fly.io (Backend)

## Business Context - Modern Foundry
**Current Service:** Authority Avalanche at $2,500/month (3-month minimum)
**Target:** Scale to 50+ clients with Brand BOS automation
**Revenue Impact:** $125,000+/month with systematic automation
**Strategic Value:** Category leadership in "Brand Operating Systems"

## Next Steps for CTO Oversight
1. **Review PRPs** in detail for technical architecture validation
2. **Validate technical decisions** against Modern Foundry requirements  
3. **Establish development workflow** using Claude Code
4. **Set up development environment** with proper credentials
5. **Begin Phase 1 implementation** starting with CIA system foundation
6. **Implement validation loops** for quality assurance throughout development

## Critical Files for CTO Review
**Must Read First:**
- `PRPs/01_CIA_System_Complete.md` - Complete CIA implementation blueprint
- `PRPs/02_Cartwheel_Content_Engine.md` - Complete Cartwheel implementation blueprint  
- `examples/` directory - All implementation patterns and code examples
- `documents/Project Waterfall - Complete Technical Specification.md` - Full system architecture

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Context Window Limits:** Master Archive system + 70% handover thresholds
- **API Rate Limiting:** Exponential backoff + fallback caching  
- **Quality Control:** Human approval workflows + validation frameworks
- **Data Isolation:** Supabase RLS + comprehensive testing
- **Framework Preservation:** Explicit validation tests for customer psychology frameworks

## White-Label Potential
System designed for white-label deployment:
- **Configurable branding** throughout interface
- **Client-specific customization** via checkbox controls
- **Multi-tenant architecture** supports unlimited agency resale
- **API-first design** enables custom integrations
